# Goal
Create an app for beginning and intermediate gardeners learn how to grow their own food by gardening.<br/>
**The problem:** Because there is so much information, most gardeners don't know where to begin.

# User Research and Synthesis
To validate my hypothesis, I interviewed four beginning and advanced gardeners about their gardening experiences. After mapping affinity diagrams based on my research, I created a provisional persona of who I planned to target. I also performed a competitive analysis of direct and indirect competitors.

# Sketching and Creating User Flows
I began with sketching and paper prototyping usability tests. Based on the results of my tests and with the additions of the content elements defined in the feature prioritization/site mapping and card sorting exercises, I decided I needed to revise my original user flow.
Thumbnail sketches were made on paper, cut out and arranged to map out the flow. The revised user flows were mapped out in Sketch.

# Wireframes
Wireframes were created from the sketches, fit into the user flows and a prototype was created after exporting the wireframes to Invision.
