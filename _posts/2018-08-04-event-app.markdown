# Meeting with Stakeholders
First, we met with the internal team working on developing the application to find out what their problems were with the current application. Previously, they had had to contract with an outside agency to rebrand the application each time a client needed it to be branded, resulting in high costs. The goal was to streamline the process so that only fonts, colors and graphics would change per client, and the work could be done internally.

# Ideating
Members of the design team sketched out and mocked up their ideas. We met and discussed which aspects of the mockups we thought best solved the problem.

# Creating the user flow
Working with my manager, I merged the best ideas into a series of mockups and created three user flows—one for proctors, another for reviewers and another for admins.
