# Initial Designs
A fellow designer and I worked on different versions of interactive email design that would be mobile-friendly and easy to rebrand on a client by client basis. My version had initial designs branded for Target and Yeti, with the goal of making them easy to implement and mobile first.

# Iterating
After our initial meeting, we were presented with some limitations. Since a few large email clients wouldn't have the clickable star functionality, we were asked to implement ratings using radios. We were also asked to match the design of the multi-product submission. I designed a new concept using Home Depot that kept my original design while addressing the limitations.
