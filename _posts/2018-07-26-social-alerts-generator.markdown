# Wireframes
Our internal Design team had previously had a tool for creating branded email templates for clients. However, the original team that created it wasn't maintaining the tool any more, and we had created a new responsive branded email Social Alert service we would be pitching to clients. My manager set out a plan/outline for the tool, but we needed something  that our internal developer could use as the blueprints for creating the tool. Based on the requirements and our initial brainstorms, I prepared the user flow wireframes with instructions to hand off to the developer.
