# Wireframes
Design Services had previously had a tool for creating Social Alerts. However, the internal team wasn't maintaining the tool any more, and we had created a new responsive branded email Social Alert service we would be pitching to clients. My manager had set out a plan/outline for the tool, but we needed something concrete that our internal developer could use as the blueprints for creating the tool. Using a Bootstrap UI kit in Sketch, I prepared the initial screens and instructions to hand off to our developer.
